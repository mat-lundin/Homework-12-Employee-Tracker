## Installation
To install, download the repository files and run ```npm i``` in the terminal from the root folder to install all dependencies (Express in this case). The database will need to be created and seeded by running the ```schema.sql``` and ```seeds.sql``` files in the mySQL terminal.

## Usage
To use, run ```node app.js``` in the terminal. The prompts will guide the user through views, additions, and role changes via the prompts. In future releases the developer hopes to add choices for adding roles and departments instead of prompting for id numbers.
